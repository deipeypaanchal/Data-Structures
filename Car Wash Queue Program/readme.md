Programâ€™s Purpose

>> The purpose of this program is to keep track of vehicles that are in line for a car wash.
>> It uses a queue that is created in the form of a circularly linked list.
>> This allows for the program to easily go through the queue and helps the user keep track of each individual node.
>> The program also helps the user keep track of the type of vehicle that is in the queue.
>> It keeps track of cars and trucks and specifies which is being washed in the output.
>> The program also allows the user to know the license plate numbers and models of each car that is in the queue.
>> In a real-world scenario, this would allow the user to know the exact number of cars that were washed in case something were to happen.
>> It also helps the user understand how well business is going.
>> The dequeue and enqueue functions also allow the list to be easily manipulated whenever a car is washed or a new car enters the queue.
