The purpose of this program is to track vehicles in line for a car wash. 

It utilizes a circularly linked list to create a queue. 

This enables easy traversal of the queue and helps the user monitor each node individually. 

The program also assists the user in tracking the vehicle types in the queue, distinguishing between cars and trucks during output. 

Additionally, the program provides the user with license plate numbers and car models for each vehicle in the queue. 

In real-world scenarios, this information proves useful for determining the exact number of cars washed and addressing any incidents that may occur. 

Moreover, it aids the user in assessing the business's performance. 

The dequeue and enqueue functions facilitate convenient manipulation of the list when a car is washed or a new car enters the queue.
